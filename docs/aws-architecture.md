# AWS Architecture for BlogTube Platform

This document outlines the AWS services and architecture used for the BlogTube platform.

## Overview

The BlogTube platform uses several AWS services to provide a scalable, secure, and reliable infrastructure for storing and serving blog content, user data, and media files.

## AWS Services Used

### 1. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

S3 is used for storing:
- Blog content (HTML/Markdown)
- User-uploaded images
- Static assets (CSS, JS, icons)
- Video thumbnails

**Bucket Structure:**
- `blogtube-content`: Stores blog content and metadata
- `blogtube-user-uploads`: Stores user-uploaded images and media
- `blogtube-assets`: Stores static assets for the website

### 2. Amazon Cognito

Cognito is used for user authentication and authorization:
- User sign-up and sign-in
- Social identity provider integration (Google, Facebook)
- JWT token generation for API access
- User pool management

### 3. Amazon DynamoDB

DynamoDB is used for storing:
- User profile data
- Blog metadata
- Comments and interactions
- Subscription relationships

**Table Structure:**
- `blogtube-users`: User profiles and preferences
- `blogtube-blogs`: Blog metadata and statistics
- `blogtube-comments`: User comments on blogs
- `blogtube-subscriptions`: User subscription relationships

### 4. AWS Lambda

Lambda functions are used for serverless operations:
- Image processing and resizing
- Blog content processing
- Notification handling
- Search indexing

**Key Functions:**
- `blogtube-create-blog`: Processes and stores new blog posts
- `blogtube-update-blog`: Handles blog updates
- `blogtube-delete-blog`: Manages blog deletion and cleanup
- `blogtube-upload-image`: Processes and optimizes uploaded images
- `blogtube-process-image`: Creates different sizes/formats of images

### 5. Amazon API Gateway

API Gateway provides RESTful APIs for:
- Blog CRUD operations
- User management
- Search functionality
- Comment management

### 6. Amazon CloudFront

CloudFront is used as a CDN to:
- Deliver static assets with low latency
- Cache blog content
- Serve images and media files

### 7. Amazon ElasticSearch Service

ElasticSearch is used for:
- Full-text search across blog content
- Faceted search by categories, tags, authors
- Search suggestions and autocomplete

## Security Considerations

1. **S3 Bucket Policies**:
   - Public read access only for published content
   - Private write access through pre-signed URLs
   - Encryption at rest using SSE-S3

2. **Cognito Security**:
   - MFA for sensitive operations
   - Password policies
   - IP-based restrictions

3. **API Security**:
   - JWT token validation
   - Rate limiting
   - WAF integration

4. **Data Protection**:
   - Encryption in transit (HTTPS)
   - Encryption at rest
   - Regular security audits

## Deployment Architecture

The application follows a serverless architecture pattern:

1. **Frontend**: Next.js application deployed on Vercel
2. **API Layer**: API Gateway + Lambda functions
3. **Data Layer**: DynamoDB + S3
4. **Auth Layer**: Cognito
5. **Search Layer**: ElasticSearch

## Scaling Considerations

- DynamoDB auto-scaling for handling traffic spikes
- Lambda concurrency limits set appropriately
- CloudFront caching to reduce origin requests
- S3 Transfer Acceleration for faster uploads

## Cost Optimization

- S3 Intelligent Tiering for infrequently accessed content
- Lambda provisioned concurrency for predictable workloads
- DynamoDB on-demand capacity for variable traffic
- CloudFront caching to reduce origin requests

## Monitoring and Logging

- CloudWatch for metrics and alarms
- X-Ray for tracing requests
- CloudTrail for API activity logging
- S3 access logging

## Disaster Recovery

- Cross-region replication for critical S3 buckets
- DynamoDB global tables for multi-region resilience
- Regular backups of configuration and data
- Documented recovery procedures
